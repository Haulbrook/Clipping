## 🚀 Deployment Steps (In Order)

### STEP 1: Deploy Backend to Google Apps Script
📖 **Follow:** `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**Quick Summary:**
1. Go to https://script.google.com
2. Create new project: "Deep Roots Inventory Backend"
3. Copy entire `code.js` into Code.gs
4. Deploy as Web App (Execute as: User, Access: Anyone)
5. Copy the Web App URL

⏱️ **Time:** ~5 minutes
👤 **Manual:** Yes (requires your Google login)

---

### STEP 2: Update Configuration

**Edit `config.json`:**
```json
{
  "services": {
    "inventory": {
      "url": "PASTE_YOUR_WEB_APP_URL_HERE"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `PASTE_YOUR_WEB_APP_URL_HERE` with the URL from Step 1.

---

### STEP 3: Deploy Frontend to GitHub Pages

#### Option A: Automatic (Recommended)

The GitHub Actions workflow is already set up! Just:

1. **Merge the pull request** (or push to main):
   ```bash
   # If you have permission to merge:
   gh pr merge --merge
   ```

2. **GitHub Pages will auto-deploy** in 2-3 minutes

3. **Access your dashboard** at:
   ```
   https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/Clipping
   ```

#### Option B: Manual Enable

If GitHub Pages isn't enabled yet:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Haulbrook/Clipping/settings/pages
2. Source: **GitHub Actions**
3. Save

The workflow will run automatically on the next push to main.

---

### STEP 4: Test Everything

1. **Open your dashboard:**
   ```
   https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/Clipping
   ```

2. **Try a search query:**
   - Type: "check mulch inventory"
   - Should see results from your backend

3. **Check browser console** (F12):
   - Should see API calls to your Google Apps Script URL
   - No errors (except missing data if sheets aren't set up)

## 🔄 Making Updates Later

### Update Backend:
1. Edit code.js in Google Apps Script online
2. Save (changes apply immediately)

### Update Frontend:
1. Edit files locally
2. Commit and push to main:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update dashboard"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. GitHub Actions auto-deploys (2-3 min)

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Branding:
- Edit `config.json` → `app.name`
- Edit `index.html` → Page title
- Add your logo in `styles/`

### Add More Tools:
- Deploy additional Apps Script tools
- Add URLs to `config.json` → `services`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

**❌ "Authorization required"**
- Fix: Set "Who has access" to "Anyone" in Apps Script deployment

**❌ "Cannot find sheet"**
- Fix: Update `CONFIG.INVENTORY_SHEET_ID` in code.js with your actual Sheet ID

### Frontend Issues

**❌ "No endpoint configured"**
- Fix: Update `config.json` with your backend URL
- Make sure it starts with `https://script.google.com/macros/s/`

**❌ 404 on CSS/JS files**
- Fix: Clear browser cache
- Check GitHub Pages is enabled
- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

**❌ CORS errors**
- Fix: Use the `/exec` URL, not `/dev`
- Make sure deployment is set to "Anyone"
